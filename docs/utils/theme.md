# Change Theme

Please do not use any higher level widget than `GetMaterialApp` in order to update it. This can trigger duplicate keys. A lot of people are used to the prehistoric approach of creating a "ThemeProvider" widget just to change the theme of your app, and this is definitely NOT necessary with **GetX™**.

You can create your custom theme and simply add it within `Get.changeTheme` without any boilerplate for that:

```dart
Get.changeTheme(ThemeData.light());
```

If you want to create something like a button that changes the Theme in `onTap`, you can combine two **GetX™** APIs for that:

- The api that checks if the dark `Theme` is being used.
- And the `Theme` Change API, you can just put this within an `onPressed`:

```dart
Get.changeTheme(Get.isDarkMode? ThemeData.light(): ThemeData.dark());
```

When `.darkmode` is activated, it will switch to the _light theme_, and when the _light theme_ becomes active, it will change to _dark theme_.
