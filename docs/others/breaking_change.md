# Breaking changes from 2.0

## Rx types

| Before  | After      |
| ------- | ---------- |
| StringX | `RxString` |
| IntX    | `RxInt`    |
| MapX    | `RxMap`    |
| ListX   | `RxList`   |
| NumX    | `RxNum`    |
| DoubleX | `RxDouble` |

RxController and GetBuilder now have merged, you no longer need to memorize which controller you want to use, just use GetxController, it will work for simple state management and for reactive as well.

## Named Routes

Before:

```dart
GetMaterialApp(
  namedRoutes: {
    '/': GetRoute(page: Home()),
  }
)
```

Now:

```dart
GetMaterialApp(
  getPages: [
    GetPage(name: '/', page: () => Home()),
  ]
)
```

Why this change?
Often, it may be necessary to decide which page will be displayed from a parameter, or a login token, the previous approach was inflexible, as it did not allow this.
Inserting the page into a function has significantly reduced the RAM consumption, since the routes will not be allocated in memory since the app was started, and it also allowed to do this type of approach:

```dart

GetStorage box = GetStorage();

GetMaterialApp(
  getPages: [
    GetPage(name: '/', page:(){
      return box.hasData('token') ? Home() : Login();
    })
  ]
)
```
