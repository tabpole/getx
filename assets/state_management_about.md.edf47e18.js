Why? In addition to building applications for android, iOS, web, windows, macos and linux, with GetX you can build server applications with the same syntax as Flutter/GetX. In order to improve response time and reduce RAM consumption, we created GetValue and GetStream, which are low latency solutions that deliver a lot of performance, at a low operating cost. We use this base to build all of our resources, including state management.</p><ul><li><em>Complexity</em>: Some state managers are complex and have a lot of boilerplate. With GetX you don&#39;t have to define a class for each event, the code is highly clean and clear, and you do a lot more by writing less. Many people have given up on Flutter because of this topic, and they now finally have a stupidly simple solution for managing states.</li><li><em>No code generators</em>: You spend half your development time writing your application logic. Some state managers rely on code generators to have minimally readable code. Changing a variable and having to run build_runner can be unproductive, and often the waiting time after a flutter clean will be long, and you will have to drink a lot of coffee.</li></ul><p>With GetX everything is reactive, and nothing depends on code generators, increasing your productivity in all aspects of your development.</p><ul><li><em>It does not depend on context</em>: You probably already needed to send the context of your view to a controller, making the View&#39;s coupling with your business logic high. You have probably had to use a dependency for a place that has no context, and had to pass the context through various classes and functions. This just doesn&#39;t exist with GetX. You have access to your controllers from within your controllers without any context. You don&#39;t need to send the context by parameter for literally nothing.</li><li><em>Granular control</em>: most state managers are based on ChangeNotifier. ChangeNotifier will notify all widgets that depend on it when notifyListeners is called. If you have 40 widgets on one screen, which have a variable of your ChangeNotifier class, when you update one, all of them will be rebuilt.</li></ul><p>With GetX, even nested widgets are respected. If you have Obx watching your ListView, and another watching a checkbox inside the ListView, when changing the CheckBox value, only it will be updated, when changing the List value, only the ListView will be updated.</p><ul><li><em>It only reconstructs if its variable REALLY changes</em>: GetX has flow control, that means if you display a Text with &#39;Paola&#39;, if you change the observable variable to &#39;Paola&#39; again, the widget will not be reconstructed. That&#39;s because GetX knows that &#39;Paola&#39; is already being displayed in Text, and will not do unnecessary reconstructions.</li></ul><p>Most (if not all) current state managers will rebuild on the screen.</p>',8),s=[i];function l(r,d,c,h,u,m){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const y=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
