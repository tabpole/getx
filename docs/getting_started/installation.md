# Install Docker on Linux

Sequential command list to install Docker on Linux

## System update & upgrade

To update your Linux system apply the following commands sequentially.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

sudo apt update updates the package index of available software packages while sudo apt upgrade upgrades all currently installed packages on a Debian-based Linux system to their latest available versions. These commands should be run periodically to keep the system up-to-date.
