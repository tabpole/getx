# Useful tips

`.obs`ervables (also known as _Rx_ Types) have a wide variety of internal methods and operators.

> Is very common to _believe_ that a property with `.obs` **IS** the actual value... but make no mistake!
> We avoid the Type declaration of the variable, because Dart's compiler is smart enough, and the code
> looks cleaner, but:

```dart
var message = 'Hello world'.obs;
print( 'Message "$message" has Type ${message.runtimeType}');
```

Even if `message` _prints_ the actual String value, the Type is **RxString**!

So, you can't do `message.substring( 0, 4 )`.
You have to access the real `value` inside the _observable_:
The most "used way" is `.value`, but, did you know that you can also use...

```dart
final name = 'GetX'.obs;
// only "updates" the stream, if the value is different from the current one.
name.value = 'Hey';

// All Rx properties are "callable" and returns the new value.
// but this approach does not accepts `null`, the UI will not rebuild.
name('Hello');

// is like a getter, prints 'Hello'.
name() ;

/// numbers:

final count = 0.obs;

// You can use all non mutable operations from num primitives!
count + 1;

// Watch out! this is only valid if `count` is not final, but var
count += 1;

// You can also compare against values:
count > 2;

/// booleans:

final flag = false.obs;

// switches the value between true/false
flag.toggle();


/// all types:

// Sets the `value` to null.
flag.nil();

// All toString(), toJson() operations are passed down to the `value`
print( count ); // calls `toString()` inside  for RxInt

final abc = [0,1,2].obs;
// Converts the value to a json Array, prints RxList
// Json is supported by all Rx types!
print('json: ${jsonEncode(abc)}, type: ${abc.runtimeType}');

// RxMap, RxList and RxSet are special Rx types, that extends their native types.
// but you can work with a List as a regular list, although is reactive!
abc.add(12); // pushes 12 to the list, and UPDATES the stream.
abc[3]; // like Lists, reads the index 3.


// equality works with the Rx and the value, but hashCode is always taken from the value
final number = 12.obs;
print( number == 12 ); // prints > true

/// Custom Rx Models:

// toJson(), toString() are deferred to the child, so you can implement override on them, and print() the observable directly.

class User {
    String name, last;
    int age;
    User({this.name, this.last, this.age});

    @override
    String toString() => '$name $last, $age years old';
}

final user = User(name: 'John', last: 'Doe', age: 33).obs;

// `user` is "reactive", but the properties inside ARE NOT!
// So, if we change some variable inside of it...
user.value.name = 'Roi';
// The widget will not rebuild!,
// `Rx` don't have any clue when you change something inside user.
// So, for custom classes, we need to manually "notify" the change.
user.refresh();

// or we can use the `update()` method!
user.update((value){
  value.name='Roi';
});

print( user );
```

## StateMixin

Another way to handle your `UI` state is use the `StateMixin<T>` .
To implement it, use the `with` to add the `StateMixin<T>`
to your controller which allows a T model.

``` dart
class Controller extends GetController with StateMixin<User>{}
```

The `change()` method change the State whenever we want.
Just pass the data and the status in this way:

```dart
change(data, status: RxStatus.success());
```

RxStatus allow these status:

``` dart
RxStatus.loading();
RxStatus.success();
RxStatus.empty();
RxStatus.error('message');
```

To represent it in the UI, use:

```dart
class OtherClass extends GetView<Controller> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(

      body: controller.obx(
        (state)=>Text(state.name),
        
        // here you can put your custom loading indicator, but
        // by default would be Center(child:CircularProgressIndicator())
        onLoading: CustomLoadingIndicator(),
        onEmpty: Text('No data found'),

        // here also you can set your own error widget, but by
        // default will be an Center(child:Text(error))
        onError: (error)=>Text(error),
      ),
    );
}
```

## GetView

I love this Widget, is so simple, yet, so useful!

Is a `const Stateless` Widget that has a getter `controller` for a registered `Controller`, that's all.

```dart
 class AwesomeController extends GetController {
   final String title = 'My Awesome View';
 }

  // ALWAYS remember to pass the `Type` you used to register your controller!
 class AwesomeView extends GetView<AwesomeController> {
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return Container(
       padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
       child: Text(controller.title), // just call `controller.something`
     );
   }
 }
```

## GetResponsiveView

Extend this widget to build responsive view.
this widget contains the `screen` property that have all
information about the screen size and type.

### How to use it

You have two options to build it.

- with `builder` method you return the widget to build.
- with methods `desktop`, `tablet`,`phone`, `watch`. the specific
  method will be built when the screen type matches the method
  when the screen is [ScreenType.Tablet] the `tablet` method
  will be exuded and so on.
  **Note:** If you use this method please set the property `alwaysUseBuilder` to `false`

With `settings` property you can set the width limit for the screen types.

## GetWidget

Most people have no idea about this Widget, or totally confuse the usage of it.
The use case is very rare, but very specific: It `caches` a Controller.
Because of the _cache_, can't be a `const Stateless`.

> So, when do you need to "cache" a Controller?

If you use, another "not so common" feature of **GetX**: `Get.create()`.

`Get.create(()=>Controller())` will generate a new `Controller` each time you call
`Get.find<Controller>()`,

That's where `GetWidget` shines... as you can use it, for example,
to keep a list of Todo items. So, if the widget gets "rebuilt", it will keep the same controller instance.

## GetxService

This class is like a `GetxController`, it shares the same lifecycle ( `onInit()`, `onReady()`, `onClose()`).
But has no "logic" inside of it. It just notifies **GetX** Dependency Injection system, that this subclass
**can not** be removed from memory.

So is super useful to keep your "Services" always reachable and active with `Get.find()`. Like:
`ApiService`, `StorageService`, `CacheService`.

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  await initServices(); /// AWAIT SERVICES INITIALIZATION.
  runApp(SomeApp());
}

/// Is a smart move to make your Services intiialize before you run the Flutter app.
/// as you can control the execution flow (maybe you need to load some Theme configuration,
/// apiKey, language defined by the User... so load SettingService before running ApiService.
/// so GetMaterialApp() doesnt have to rebuild, and takes the values directly.
void initServices() async {
  print('starting services ...');
  /// Here is where you put get_storage, hive, shared_pref initialization.
  /// or moor connection, or whatever that's async.
  await Get.putAsync(() => DbService().init());
  await Get.putAsync(SettingsService()).init();
  print('All services started...');
}

class DbService extends GetxService {
  Future<DbService> init() async {
    print('$runtimeType delays 2 sec');
    await 2.delay();
    print('$runtimeType ready!');
    return this;
  }
}

class SettingsService extends GetxService {
  void init() async {
    print('$runtimeType delays 1 sec');
    await 1.delay();
    print('$runtimeType ready!');
  }
}

```

The only way to actually delete a `GetxService`, is with `Get.reset()` which is like a
"Hot Reboot" of your app. So remember, if you need absolute persistence of a class instance during the
lifetime of your app, use `GetxService`.
